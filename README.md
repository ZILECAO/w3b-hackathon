## How to use

To make a new listing:

1. Publish a pdf of your notes to IPFS using Pinata: https://app.pinata.cloud/

2. Go to the replit above and write to the function createNewListing which requires four inputs: your name, note description, IPFS Uri, and the amount of ether you are sending (just put 0 on this last entry)

3. The website should automatically update with your listing

4. If you would like to donate to another poster, write to the donate function on replit, which requires two inputs: the itemID (double check to make sure you are donating to the right address!) and the amount of ether you want to send them

-- thus, a hub of student notes with decentralized Web3 storage and token incentives :)
